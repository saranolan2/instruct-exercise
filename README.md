# instruct-exercise

This is the completed exercise for today. I imported the csv data into a table called "services" inside a MySQL scehma called "service-catalog".

For the GET endpoint, I've tested the get-services.php api endpoint in Postman. The full endpoint is:
<url>/get-services.php?ccode=<country-code>

For the POST endpoint, unfortunately I've not been able to get the script fully functional. When finished, the endpoint would be:
<url>/update-service.php
The POST form-data paramaters would be:
ref
centre
service
country
